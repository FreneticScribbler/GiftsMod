# GiftsMod
--I don't know the first thing about Java. Well, that's a lie, but I can't write it. I had this idea for a mod, since I've been unable to find the functionality elsewhere. Presently, HQM, Lucky Blocks, and IC2 scrap material almost do the same thing that I'm looking for. I don't want add mods to my pack just to remove major, significant contributions that the mods offer. I don't think that's fair to the mod author, or the players. I'd be super grateful if someone could make this mod. I also have a few ideas for little Easter eggs, and holiday time fun things--
